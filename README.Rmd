# dyadicdist

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dyadicdist is to quickly calculate distance between geographic points and store these as dyads

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jvieroe/dyadicdist")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r getdata, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(janitor)
library(rvest)

city_url <- "https://www.latlong.net/category/cities-236-15.html"

cities <- city_url %>%
   read_html() %>%
   html_nodes("table")

cities <- rbind(html_table(cities[[1]])) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

cities <- cities %>% 
  mutate(city = sapply(strsplit(as.character(cities$place_name),","), "[", 1),
         state = sapply(strsplit(as.character(cities$place_name),","), "[", 2),
         country = sapply(strsplit(as.character(cities$place_name),","), "[", 3))

cities <- cities %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number())

cities

```

```{r, warning=F, message=F, fig.width=3, fig.height=2}
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rgeos)

usa <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries() %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf() %>% 
  filter(admin == "United States of America")

usa <- usa %>% 
  st_crop(.,
          st_bbox(c(xmin = -128,
                    xmax = -57,
                    ymin = 20,
                    ymax = 50),
                  crs = st_crs(usa)))

cit_sf <- cities %>% 
  st_as_sf(.,
           coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs = 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = usa,
          fill = "grey95") +
  geom_sf(data = cit_sf,
          size = 4,
          shape = 21,
          fill = "darkred", color = "NA",
          alpha = .6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#0D1117",
                                        color = "#0D1117"),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        plot.margin=grid::unit(c(0,0,0,0),
                               "mm"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#0D1117"))
  

```


```{r example}
#library(dyadicdist)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
