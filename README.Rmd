The purpose of `dyadicdist` is to provide quick and easy calculation of dyadic distances between geo-referenced points.

The main contribution of `dyadicdist::ddist()` and `dyadicdist::ddist_sf()` is that the output is stored as a long dyadic `tibble` as opposed to a wide `matrix`.

This is a very early development version. Please don't hesitate to let me know of any errors and/or deficiencies you might come across.

## Quick example
A simple example with no additional illustrates the workings of `ddist()`. It takes as input a `data.frame` or a `tibble` and returns a `tibble` with dyadic distances for any combination of points i and j (see more below)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(dyadicdist)

df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~city_name, ~idvar, ~latitude, ~longitude,
  "copenhagen", 5, 55.68, 12.58,
  "stockholm", 2, 59.33, 18.07,
  "oslo", 51, 59.91, 10.75
)

ddist(data = df,
      id = "idvar")

```


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jvieroe/dyadicdist")
```
## Working example: `ddist()`

Below, I describe some of the key features of `dyadicdist`. Let's use some data on the 100 largest US cities as a working example:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
cities <- dyadicdist::cities
usa <- dyadicdist::usa

```

Let's have a look at the cities' geographic location in the US:

```{r, warning=F, message=F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.25}
library(sf)

city_sf <- cities %>%
  st_as_sf(.,
           coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs = 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = usa,
          fill = "grey25", color = "white") +
  geom_sf(data = city_sf,
          size = 2.5, shape = 21, alpha = .55,
          fill = "chartreuse3", color = "NA") +
  geom_sf(data = city_sf,
          size = 2.5, shape = 21, alpha = 1.0,
          fill = "NA", color = "chartreuse3") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#0D1117"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#0D1117"))



```

## Basic functionality
`ddist()` has __two key inputs__. It requires a `data.frame` or `tibble` with specified latitude and longitude variables. Furthermore, it requires the specification of a unique id variable which can be either `numeric`, `integer`, `factor`, or `character`.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ddist(cities,
      id = "id")

```
As a default, latitude/longitude are specified as `"latitude"` and `"longitude"`, respectively, and don't need manual inputs. If necessary their variable names can be specified in the `ddist()` call:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
cities_new <- cities %>%
  rename(lat = latitude,
         lon = longitude)

ddist(cities_new,
      id = "id",
      latitude = "lat",
      longitude = "lon") %>%
  head(2)

```

## Output specification
By default, `ddist()` returns the full list of dyadic distances between any points i and j, including j = i. 

In total, this amount to `nrow(data) * nrow(data)` dyads and includes by default:

* dyads between any observation and itself, i.e. dyads of type (i,i) (see example above)
* duplicated dyads, i.e. both (i,j) and (j,i)

Both of these inclusions are optional, however. 

* Sort out (i,i) dyads (the diagonal in a distance matrix) by specifying `diagonal = FALSE`
    + returns a `tibble` with `nrow(data) * (nrow(data)-1)` dyads
* Sort out duplicated dyads by specifying `duplicates = FALSE`
    + returns a `tibble` with `(nrow(data) * (nrow(data)-1)/2)+nrow(data)` dyads
* Sort out both by specifying `diagonal = FALSE` __and__ `duplicates = FALSE`
    + returns a `tibble` with `(nrow(data) * (nrow(data)-1)/2)` dyads


## CRS transformations
By default `ddist()` assumes unprojected coordinates in basic latitude/longitude format (EPSG code `4326`) when converting the raw data provided in the `data` argument to a spatial feature. This is consistent with the default when converting latitude/longitude data to spatial features in the `sf` package (see `sf::st_as_sf()`). You can apply a different CRS by providing a valid EPSG code of type `numeric` with the `crs` argument.

Additionally, `ddist()` allows you to transform the CRS before calculating dyadic distances using the `crs_transform` and `new_crs` arguments:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ddist(cities,
      id = "id",
      crs_transform = T,
      new_crs = 3359)

```

For a list of supported CRS transformations, see `rgdal::make_EPSG()`.

Note that the choice of CRS may impact your results considerably. For more information on choosing an appropriate CRS, see [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/intro-to-coordinate-reference-systems/), [here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html), [here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf), and [here](http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm)


## Spatial input data with `ddist_sf()`
To measure dyadic distances with an object of class `sf` use `ddist_sf()`:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
cities %>%
  st_as_sf(.,
           coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs = 4326) %>%
  ddist_sf(.,
           id = "id")

```
With the exception of `crs`, `longitude`, and `latitude` (all of which are inherently provided in an object of class `sf`), `ddist_sf()` takes the same optional arguments as `ddist()`.
